# i am using laravel 6.x,
# run "composer install" from terminal (only one time).
# As i am not storing data in database, i am storing dummy data inside the array which can be found in "App\Traits\dbArray.php".
# I have used repository design pattern for this project, which is very much required for scaling the project.
# testcases can be run in terminal by using the command  "./vendor/bin/phpunit ./tests/Unit/addFlightTest.php"
